      "- This movie… WOW. As a mental health professional, survivor of deep generational trauma and a mother, this movie is everything. I hadn’t heard of it until my 6 year old son watched it in school and encouraged me to watch it with him. We’ve seen it 4 times now. It’s opened the door for us to have age appropriate discussions of self love, worthiness and forgiveness.  Disney has really come a long way.. they have produced some truly revolutionary films in the past 6-7 years and I am here for it! The animation and film score are both phenomenal as well. We have been listening to the soundtrack for a month straight and can’t get enough!\n",
      "- I had high hopes going to see this movie.  Due to covid we have not gone to the movies in a long time, but my kids really wanted to watch El Encanto, so I decided to surprise them all and take them last night.  I could not believe that I was watching a Disney movie.  The songs felt off, the story line made no sense, the cruelty towards Maribel and Bruno was disturbing, and I felt as if there was no real effort to show redemption in the grandma.  The worse part was that all of my kids ended up hating the movie.  The felt disappointed.  The only interesting character in the movie was Bruno (his back story made sense, and we were able to sympathize, and even cheer for him as he came to stand up for Maribel.  But all other characters needed less awful singing and more character building. And a better plot line, and even a recognition of how the family minus mom and dad have been treating Maribel like the black sheep.  I just felt like Disney made a mess to this hispanic movie that could have been so beautiful and full of magic and traditions.  Sadly this is one movie I won't be collecting for my Disney collection shelf, and if I could get my $80 movie tickets refunded I truly would, this movie felt that bad.\n",

To much singing and very hard story line...loved Coco, was hoping for same, I'm very disappointed in the story line.  Being Latina I so hoped much better in the story line...I give this movie a 3 and that's only for the wonderful colors in this movie.\n",

Mirabel just forgiving the grandma for being so horrible without her actually putting in ANY effort to not be horrible was poorly written. Not to mention the lackluster songs....I don't understand why people love this movie.\n",
      "- Wonderful movie! Lovely, bright colours, catchy songs, likeable characters, fun family movie! I love this movie so much and so do my kids! It's such a great film for families, with diverse characters. Includes a strong female lead which is great for young girls. Demonstrating that differences are not weaknesses, which is a positive message. Great role models, funny characters. Creative movie! \n",

      "- Amazing music , fun to watch! Could of had a little more development with characters and more actually happen but kid loved it!\n",
      "- This movie uses colorful imagery and song to portray itself as some sort of whimsical children's movie, however both my kids started to have nightmares after watching this movie and kept saying how scary it was. The subplots of this film (which mostly center on anxiety and abandonment) are more appropriate for adolescents or millenials than actual kids. It's another example of how Disney has forgotten who it's primary audience is. The art style comes across as dark and the characters just had a creepy look to them. My kids were terrified of the green glowing hooded Bruno guy and he made Mother Gothel or Uncle Scar look friendly and bright by comparison.  Utimately this could have been a good movie that suffered because of a poor choice of style/art. The characters just looked creepy and my kids picked up on it immediately.\n",
